            ONE OF THE TASKS WE HAD WAS TO CREATE A PORTRAIT USING A REALLY NEW WAY FOR ME, WHICH IS CREATIVE CODING.
            <br>
            <br>
            THE VERY FIRST TRY WE HAD, WAS TO STYLE A PHOTO. I REMEMBER HOW I WAS SURPRISED THAT USING CODE YOU CAN DO
            SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IT WAS ALSO UNEXPECTEDLY EASY:) WHICH UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SAY ABOUT THE NEXT
            PORTRAIT I DID. MATH WAS NEVER MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT, AND TO BE HONEST I STRUGGLED.

            WHILE I GAVE IT MY BEST SHOT, CREATING A PORTRAIT USING P5.JS WASN'T QUITE MY CUP OF TEA. AS SOMEONE WHO'S
            MORE INCLINED TOWARDS DRAWING OR PAINTING, I FOUND THE PROCESS OF CODING A PORTRAIT TO BE LESS FULFILLING
            THAN I HAD HOPED.
            <br><br>
            I DO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING DIFFERENT MEDIUMS AND TECHNIQUES, CODING JUST DIDN'T RESONATE WITH ME
            IN THE SAME WAY THAT TRADITIONAL ART DOES.
            <br><br>
            WORKING WITH SHAPES AND LINES TO REPRESENT FACIAL FEATURES FELT LIMITING, AND I MISSED THE SPONTANEITY AND
            FREEDOM THAT COMES WITH HAND-CREATING. 
            <br><br>
            IN THE END, WHILE I'M THANKFUL FOR THE CHANCE TO LEARN NEW SKILLS, I REALIZE THAT I'M MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT
            OTHER CREATIVE PURSUITS, WHERE I FEEL LESS STRESSED AND MORE FULFILLED.
